# Restaurant-Order-Analysis-SQL
Restaurant Orders and Menu Data Analysis Using SQL

🎯 Purpose:

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze restaurant operations data to understand customer behavior, order patterns, and menu performance. By querying the dataset, insights were drawn about popular items, order frequency, sales trends, and dining preferences, which could help optimize menu design and improve restaurant decision-making.

⚙️ Tech Stack:

SQL (MySQL Workbench) – for database creation, querying, and analysis
Excel / CSV Export – for additional data visualization 
Power BI / Tableau (optional) – for further visualization of SQL insights

📂 Data Source:

The dataset was downloaded from Maven Analytics
.
It contains information about orders, menu items, and order details, simulating a real-world restaurant transaction system.

🧩 Database Structure:

The project consists of the following tables:

menu_items – Contains details of menu items (item name, category, and price)

order_details – Includes order IDs, timestamps, and associated menu items

orders (if applicable in your exploration) – Tracks each customer’s full order transaction

💡 Key Insights & Analysis Performed:

Explored customer ordering behavior based on time and date.

Identified most frequently ordered items and top-selling categories.

Calculated average order value and total revenue by item type.

Analyzed peak ordering hours to understand rush periods.

Investigated menu pricing trends and performance by item category.

Discovered patterns in multi-item orders indicating customer preferences.

📊 Outcome:

The SQL queries and analyses provided actionable insights into restaurant operations, helping to understand what items drive sales, when customers order most frequently, and how pricing affects demand
