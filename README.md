## 🏷️ Title
**Restaurant Orders and Menu Data Analysis Using SQL**

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this project is to explore and analyze restaurant operational data to gain insights into customer ordering behavior, popular menu items, and sales performance.  
Through SQL queries, I investigated trends in orders, item preferences, and peak business hours to help improve restaurant decision-making and customer satisfaction.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Tools Used:**
  - **MySQL Workbench** – for executing SQL queries and database management  
  - **Excel / CSV Export** – for additional visualization (optional)  
  - **Power BI / Tableau (optional)** – for data visualization of SQL outputs

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset was obtained from **[Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/)**.  
It simulates a real-world restaurant database and includes information about:
- **Orders**
- **Menu items**
- **Order details**

## 🧩 Database Schema
The database (`restaurant_db`) consists of the following key tables:

- **`menu_items`** – Contains item details such as name, category, and price.  
- **`order_details`** – Stores order IDs, timestamps, and associated item IDs.  
- **`orders`** (if used) – Represents individual customer transactions.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Explored **order details** to identify most frequently ordered items.  
- Analyzed **sales by category** and calculated total revenue.  
- Determined **average order value** and **popular menu combinations**.  
- Identified **peak hours** and **most active days** for restaurant operations.  
- Examined **price distribution** across different menu categories.  
- Investigated **customer behavior** and ordering frequency patterns.

## 💡 Key Insights
- Certain menu items (like appetizers and beverages) had significantly higher order frequencies.  
- **Dinner hours** saw the most customer activity, especially between **7 PM – 9 PM**.  
- **High-value combos** and **dessert add-ons** contributed noticeably to total revenue.  
- Average order values varied by time of day and menu category, revealing potential for dynamic pricing.  
- The data structure supports scalability for integrating customer-level analysis in future.

## 📊 Outcome
This project demonstrates the power of SQL for performing end-to-end data exploration and insight generation.  
The analysis helps understand customer preferences, optimize menu pricing, and improve restaurant operations through data-driven decisions.
